# Face-Recognition
**Overview**
This project involves building a face recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The objective is to accurately identify individuals from a dataset of facial images. The dataset contains 40 distinct individuals with multiple images per person.

**Project Structure**

**Dataset:** The dataset consists of 40 persons images with each person has 10 different expression images.

**Preprocessing:** Images are resized and normalized to ensure uniformity and facilitate efficient model training.

**Model Design:** A CNN architecture is designed to extract and learn features from the facial images.

**Training:** The model is trained using the preprocessed images with appropriate labels.

**Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its accuracy and performance.
